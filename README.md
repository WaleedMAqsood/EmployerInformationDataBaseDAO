# EmployerInformationDataBaseDAO
Technologies used are Java,JDBC,SQL Server.The reason I wanted to do this project was to have a good understaning of JDBC.Many frameworks work on top of JDBC so its always helpful to have good understanding of JDBC. This is a simple project which uses DAO design Pattern.DAO design Pattern is based on abstraction and encapsulation design principles.It hides the rest of the application from any change in the persistence layer e.g. change of database from MYSql to SQL Server. By using the DAO design pattern your View Layer is completely independent of the DAO layer and only the Service layer has the dependency on it which is also abstracted by using the DAO interface.
User can Insert(one or multiple),delete,update,delete all records form the database.
